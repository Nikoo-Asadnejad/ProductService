# ProductService

Welcome to the ProductService repository. This project is a sample implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and Clean Architecture using .NET. It demonstrates a modern approach to building scalable and maintainable applications.

 ## Overview

ProductService is designed to manage product-related operations in an e-commerce system. The project adheres to the following architectural principles:

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Organizes code around the business domain, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and encapsulation of business logic.
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Separates read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.
- Clean Architecture: Ensures that the application is structured in a way that maintains a separation between core business logic and external concerns.

## Key Features

- Fluent Validation: Implemented for validating inputs in a fluent and expressive manner.
Internal Message Queue: Uses .NET channels to handle internal messaging and communication between components.
Domain Event Handlers: Processes domain events to trigger actions or updates based on changes in the domain model.
CQRS with MediatR: Utilizes MediatR for implementing the CQRS pattern, handling commands and queries in a decoupled manner.
Architecture

- Domain Layer
Entities: Core business objects representing concepts like Product.
Value Objects: Immutable types representing attributes with business logic.
Aggregates: Consist of entities and value objects to enforce consistency rules.

- Application Layer
Commands and Command Handlers: Defines actions and their corresponding handlers for processing write operations.
Queries and Query Handlers: Defines read operations and their handlers for fetching data.

- Infrastructure Layer
Repositories: Implement data access logic and repository patterns to interact with data sources.
Message Queue: Implements internal messaging using .NET channels for asynchronous communication.

- Presentation Layer
API Controllers: Expose endpoints for interacting with the service, handling HTTP requests and responses.

- Validation
Fluent Validation is used to ensure that inputs meet the required specifications before processing.

- Internal Messaging
Internal communication between components is handled using .NET channels. This provides a scalable approach to managing asynchronous tasks and events.

- Domain Events
Domain events are published and handled to manage changes in the domain model. This allows for decoupled and efficient processing of domain-related actions.
